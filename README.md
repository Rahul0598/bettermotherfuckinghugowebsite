# Hugo Simple Theme
This is a very simple and lightweight Hugo Theme inspired by the geniuses behind [bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/).

However it contains a few modern niceties like non-ugly tables, ability to embed pdfs and videos, and a few other things. It contains *extremely minimal* css and js files; i.e. just enough so that you can, say, toggle a long Table of Contents.

## Features


- Embed video with `{{< video src="video.webm">}}`. Note that only .webm files are supported but this is easily extended.
- Embed pdf with `{{< pdf src="pdf_file.pdf">}}`.
- Insert a table of contents with `{{< toc>}}`.
- Latex support with `katex: true` in header.
- Add a 'back to top' button with `back_to_top: true` in header.
